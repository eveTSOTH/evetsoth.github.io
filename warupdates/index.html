<p> </p>
<p>On 30th October 2022 TSOTH started a major military offensive against the nullsec powers of EVE, as part of our plan to radically reset the nullsec political landscape and shape it into a better ecosystem, one of lots of little independent groups. Our vision is for the complete eradication of superpowers, a removal of titan blobs, and a return to how nullsec was in years gone by. This is the war log</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>6/1/2023 - Train Wreck surrenders to TSOTH!</h3>
<p>Train Wreck Alliance, who wardecced us last week, have now surrendered unconditionally to TSOTH with the war officially ending tomorrow. Their short-lived offensive campaign against us has ended in severe embarassment for Train Wreck leadership who we understand sold the war to their members as a quick and easy victory. Instead, we made sure they were constantly bogged down in demoralizing structure defence fleets, having to protect their War HQ from bombardment round the clock by TSOTH forces. It seems they were ill equipped to fight a proper war, as they quickly grew tired of being on the defensive and surrendered within a week of starting their war of aggression against us.</p>
<h3>30/12/2022</h3>
<p>Train Wreck Alliance have joined the occupiers in their hostility against us and are attempting to open up a second front into Metropolis via the Miroitem system. Our defence forces have engaged them and are so far managing to halt their offensive and prevent them moving into Metropolis but we have suffered a small number of losses in doing so, including a Proteus-class cruiser. In spite of the fact we are now fighting a war on two fronts, advancing into Horde territory while also having to keep some forces in reserve to prevent the enemy advancing into Metropolis, we are cancelling the mandatory mission running order as we believe it is no longer necessary.
</p>
<h3>Day 41 (09/12/2022)</h3>
<p>TSOTH forces pushing into the occupiers nullsec territory have successfully destroyed an enemy mobile observatory. This has degraded their intelligence capability on tracking any cloaked ships in the star system.</p>
<h3>Day 39 (07/12/2022)</h3>
<p>We have begun our assault on the occupiers nullsec space. Two structures in Paala were successfully reinforced today, as prelude to a wider assault on the Paala-LXQ regional gateway. We will push into Etherium Reach and start dismantling the aggressors structures in the region. </p>
<h3>Day 13 (11/11/2022)</h3>
<p>We have successfully liberated the areas of Metropolis that the occupier seized on Monday. Our counter offensive was swift and severe. The occupier has now been fully repulsed from the Lirerim system and we will be reanchoring new TSOTH structures shortly.</p>
<h3>Day 9 (07/11/2022)</h3>
<p>Lirerim is under heavy bombardment by the aggressors. CEO Carlos warren has ordered the corporation capital moved to Amo, deep in TSOTH controlled territory and safely a long distance from the frontline. The aggressors brazen assault on Lirerim, the system we have called our home for over a year, shows how much contempt the nullsec power blocs have for us and ultimately prove why this war was necessary. We are fighting Goons and Panfam not out of a desire for war, but in self defence. The mandatory mission running and 60% tax will remain in place, although the leadership recognize the strain this is putting on people and we will look to reducing it in the next few weeks. For now it is important everyone pulls together and steps up to do their bit for the war effort. The aggressor will not break our spirit, we will endure this hardship, and turn the tables, and emerge victorious!</p>
<h3>Day 8 (06/11/2022)</h3>
<p>The corp is preparing a counter-offensive to retake the parts of Metropolis seized by the enemy. To finance this we are raising corp tax to 60% and implementing a mandatory krabbing order. You must be running missions if you are online. By working together through these difficult times, we will achieve victory over the aggressors. We will repulse their small territorial gains, we will push them out of our region, and then we will continue to advance into their regions and start burning their structures</p>
<h3>Day 5 (03/11/2022)</h3>
<p>We have started hunting down enemy structures owned by the hostile forces, and are mapping out their fittings and vulnerabilty timers in preparation for targeted strike. </p>
<h3>Day 4 (02/11/2022)</h3>
<p>Our defence forces have shot down another 23 faction drones belonging to the occupiers. We are in contact with merc allies about the possibliity of them providing military assistance. Four days into the war, the occupiers have still not managed to shoot down a single TSOTH ship, and have suffered embarassing losses to their own forces.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Day 3 (01/11/2022)</h3>
<p>A BLACKFLAG assault on Itamo resulted in minor territorial victory for the occupier, seizing control of a strategically unimportant Astrahus in that system. Our defence forces shot down 18 enemy drones, while we suffered zero ship losses.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Day 2 (31/10/2022)</h3>
<p>TSOTH successfully repulsed an attempt by BLACKFLAG to seize one of our Astrahus in the Itamo system.</p>
